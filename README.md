ðŸ“‹ Project Quality & Best Practices Report:



âœ… Authentication State Management
Token is only set after successful login, not after registration.
User info updates instantly after login/logout.
Handles token expiration and invalid tokens gracefully.


âœ… React State Updates
Always uses the latest state value for authentication and user info.
Passes new token directly to functions when needed.
No bugs from asynchronous state updates.


âœ… Error Handling
User-friendly toast notifications for all errors (login, registration, network).
Logs errors for debugging.
Handles API errors (401 Unauthorized) by clearing token and redirecting to login.
UI fallbacks for missing user info.
Disables buttons during async actions to prevent double submissions.


âœ… Code Structure & Context Cleanliness
No duplicate logic or redundant API calls.
Context/provider only exposes whatâ€™s needed.
Authentication logic is centralized in context.


âœ… Security Best Practices
Only stores authentication token in localStorage.
No sensitive info (like passwords) stored in localStorage or state.
API URLs use HTTPS in production.
Frontend and backend validate user input.


âœ… UI/UX Best Practices
Clear feedback for all user actions (loading spinners, success/error toasts).
Accessible forms with proper labels and input types.
Navigation and messages are consistent.


âœ… Component Design
Components are focused and maintainable.
Global state managed in context, local state in components.
No unnecessary state duplication.


âœ… API Integration
Backend returns consistent, predictable data structures.
Frontend handles all possible backend responses (success, error, unauthorized).
Defensive coding with fallbacks for unexpected data.


âœ… Code Quality
No unused imports or variables.
Consistent formatting and naming conventions.
Comments for complex logic.
ESLint and Prettier used for code style.


âœ… Testing
Ready for unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
All critical user flows (register, login, logout, error cases) are covered.
